    "english_summary": "NYU is withholding the diploma of Gallatin graduate Logan Rozos after his graduation speech on Wednesday, May 15, 2024, at the Beacon Theatre, condemned actions in Gaza, supported politically and militarily by the U.S. Rozos's speech, where he used the word \"genocide,\" sparked both cheers and boos, and was followed by an apology from Gallatin Dean Victoria Rosner. NYU administration, including spokesperson John Beckman, criticized Rozos for misusing his role and deviating from his approved speech. Various groups, including NYU Alumni for Justice in Palestine and Faculty & Staff for Justice in Palestine, are urging NYU to release Rozos's diploma, citing academic freedom. Conversely, groups like EndJewHatred and the Anti-Defamation League applauded NYU's disciplinary action. This event raises concerns about freedom of speech and potential restrictions on expressing political views, particularly regarding sensitive topics, for NYU students. The incident echoes a previous situation where a valedictorian was prohibited from delivering a pro-Palestine speech last year, suggesting a pattern of censorship.",

    "english_summary": "During NYU's 2025 commencement at Yankee Stadium on Thursday, May 15th, some graduates protested President Linda Mills' address, the second such demonstration regarding NYU's handling of pro-Palestinian speech. Mills' speech did not address President Trump's recent actions against U.S. colleges, including potential funding cuts and threats to student visas. NYU is among 10 schools facing federal scrutiny for its response to alleged antisemitism and one of 52 being investigated for diversity initiatives. Recently, some NYU international students experienced alterations to their immigration statuses due to federal actions, though their statuses were reinstated three weeks prior. The specific number of affected students remains undisclosed. These federal actions highlight potential instability in immigration policies impacting NYU's international student population.",

While the specific amount of the grant is not disclosed, its absence has directly impacted admissions for the program at NYU Grossman. Current NYU Chinese international students considering or already enrolled in programs affiliated with or similar to the MD-Ph.D. program should be aware of potential funding vulnerabilities. It is advisable to closely monitor updates regarding program funding and consult with academic advisors about alternative financial aid options if needed. Future program admission decisions may also be affected. The school's administration has not yet released detailed information on the long-term impact.",
