    "english_summary": "NYU is withholding the diploma of Gallatin graduate Logan Rozos following his graduation speech on Wednesday, where he condemned a \"genocide currently occurring\" in Gaza. The university claims Rozos misused his speaking role and violated university rules by deviating from his approved speech. This incident occurred at the Gallatin graduation ceremony in the Beacon Theatre. NYU's action has sparked criticism from student, faculty, alumni, and civil rights groups, including NYU Alumni for Justice in Palestine and Faculty & Staff for Justice in Palestine. Some perceive this as a violation of academic freedom and suppression of pro-Palestinian speech, while others, like the Anti-Defamation League, support NYU's disciplinary action. The situation highlights ongoing tensions surrounding freedom of speech and political expression within NYU, potentially impacting international students' understanding and navigation of these sensitive issues, especially regarding Middle Eastern affairs. It's crucial to be aware of NYU's policies regarding speech and potential consequences for expressing controversial views.",

    "chinese_news_report": "据WSN报道，2025年5月16日消息：纽约大学 (NYU) 暂扣了加勒廷学院 (Gallatin) 毕业生洛根·罗佐斯 (Logan Rozos) 的毕业文凭。原因是罗佐斯在周三的毕业典礼上发表了演讲，谴责在加沙发生的“种族灭绝”。\n\n校方声称，罗佐斯滥用了其发言机会，并因偏离经批准的演讲稿而违反了校规。 该事件发生在信标剧院 (Beacon Theatre) 举行的加勒廷学院毕业典礼上。\n\n纽约大学的这一举动引发了学生、教职员工、校友和民权组织的批评，其中包括“纽约大学支持巴勒斯坦正义校友会 (NYU Alumni for Justice in Palestine)”和“支持巴勒斯坦正义教职员工 (Faculty & Staff for Justice in Palestine)”。\n\n一些人认为此举侵犯了学术自由，并压制了支持巴勒斯坦的言论。 但另一些人，例如反诽谤联盟 (Anti-Defamation League)，则支持纽约大学的纪律处分。\n\n该事件凸显了纽约大学内部围绕言论自由和政治表达的持续紧张关系。 这可能会影响国际学生对这些敏感问题的理解和处理，尤其是在中东事务方面。 了解纽约大学关于言论的政策以及表达有争议观点可能造成的后果至关重要。",

    "english_summary": "During NYU's 2025 commencement at Yankee Stadium on Thursday, graduates booed President Linda Mills and some walked out in protest of NYU's handling of pro-Palestinian speech. President Mills' address, focused on the importance of relationships, made no mention of the Trump administration's recent actions impacting higher education. NYU is among institutions facing scrutiny from the federal government regarding antisemitism complaints and diversity programs. Recently, an unspecified number of NYU international students experienced changes to their immigration statuses due to federal policy shifts targeting noncitizens at universities. While these students' statuses were reportedly reactivated three weeks ago, President Mills has not publicly commented on these policy changes or their impact on NYU's international student population, which is a crucial concern for Chinese students at NYU. The implications of federal funding cuts and potential visa threats remain uncertain for NYU's international community.",

    "english_summary": "NYU Grossman School of Medicine recently rescinded acceptance offers to nine prospective students for its joint MD-Ph.D. program, a decision announced earlier this year. This action follows the loss of a significant federal grant that financially supported the program. While the specific amount of the grant and precise date of withdrawal are not detailed, the loss directly impacts the program's funding structure. For Chinese international students considering or currently enrolled in similar joint programs at NYU, this incident highlights the potential vulnerability of programs reliant on external funding. This situation emphasizes the importance of understanding the financial stability and funding sources of academic programs, as well as potential contingency plans in case of funding changes. Current and prospective students are advised to inquire about program funding security with relevant NYU departments.",
